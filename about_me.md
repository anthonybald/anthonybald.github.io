I graduated in May of 2017 with a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Pomona College. While there, I had the opportunity to work with Professors Michael Steinberger and Tahir Andrabi.

In July of 2017, I joined Brown University as a Predoctoral Fellow under Professor Justine Hastings.

This upcoming fall, I will start at Harvard University as a PhD student in Public Policy.
