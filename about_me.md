I graduated from Pomona College in May of 2017 with a Bachelor's degree in Economics. 
While there, I had the opportunity to work primarily with Drs. Tahir Andrabi and Michael Steinberger.

In July of 2017, I joined Brown University as a Predoctoral Fellow under Dr. Justine Hastings.

This fall, I will start at Harvard as a Ph.D. student in Public Policy.
