Hello, and welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate in Public Policy at Harvard University studying labor economics, public finance, and education policy. I am currently working on child welfare and school finance.

Previously, I worked as a research assistant to Dr. Justine Hastings at Brown University. I graduated from Pomona College in 2017.
